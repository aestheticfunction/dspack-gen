/**
 * Contract-copy drift check (dspack-gen#7).
 *
 * The ecosystem deliberately carries copies of shared artifacts (the shadcn
 * v0.3 contract; see the manifest below) instead of a shared package — repo
 * rule: no shared types/utils package. The price of copies is silent drift;
 * this script makes drift loud: every entry must match its source of truth
 * BYTE-FOR-BYTE. CI runs it on every push/PR; a red check means the source
 * moved (or the copy was edited locally) — run with --write to re-sync,
 * then regenerate anything derived (goldens) and commit both together.
 *
 * Boring by design: node builtins + global fetch, one retry, no deps.
